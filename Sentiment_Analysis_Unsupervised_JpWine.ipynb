The experience i had i would describe as very comfortable like being snug under a blanket on a cold rainy day. i sip this with my friend through the night and just enjoyed the flavors. That being said, it is more expensive and i feel that for that price, you could get a better whisky. i am not saying this because of the no age but rather, i think you can get more from other scotch for that price. But if you have it in your vault already, its really enjoyable.\n",

      "This is a terrible Yamazaki.  Very young, unsherried, no finish.  The Yamazaki 12 is slightly better.  The new Hibiki NAS \"Harmony\" is still better and a better value than the Yamazaki 12.  The Limited Edition Yamazakis brought out each year are good value and an excellent every day dram. The Yamazaki 18 is a very good sherry bomb, unfortunately insanely over-priced.  Yamazaki Sherry Cask is one of great bottles, difficult to obtain.  The Yamazaki 25 is in a world of it's own and bears no relation to any of the others.  It is one of the greatest whisky expressions ever created.\n",

This whisky is nonsensical for its price and unworthy of all the hype that Yamazaki or singke malts have been getting. It’s so coarse it’s doesn’t seem very far removed from lab-grade alcohol. The distiller should never have released this (or do they take their customers for fools?). Disappointment.\n",
